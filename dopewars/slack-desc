dopewars: dopewars is a free Unix/Win32 rewrite of a game originally based on 
dopewars: 'Drug Wars' by John E. Dell. The idea of dopewars is to deal in 
dopewars: drugs on the streets of New York, amassing a huge fortune and paying 
dopewars: off the loan shark, while avoiding the ever-annoying police.
