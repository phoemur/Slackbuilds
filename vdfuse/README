This  Fuse  module  uses the VirtualBox access library to
open a VirtualBox supported VD image file and mount it as a  Fuse  file
system.  The mount point contains a flat directory containing the files
EntireDisk, Partition1 .. PartitionN.  These can then be  loop  mounted
to access the underlying file systems

USAGE: vdfuse [options] -f image-file mountpoint

Example:

# vdfuse -r -f virtualdisk.vdi /mnt/vdi

Then there will be some files. ex.: /mnt/vdi/EntireDisk and /mnt/vdi/Partition1 ...N
Loop mount the partition you want, ex.:
# mount -o loop /mnt/vdi/Partition1 /mnt/mountpoint

And your image will be mounted in /mnt/mountpoint
